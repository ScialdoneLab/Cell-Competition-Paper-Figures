# Cell-Competition-Paper-Figures
The repository includes the script **Source data figures** for reproducing the main figures 1 (B,C,E), 2 (A,D,E,F), 3 (C), 6 (A-I) and the extended figures 1 (A-F), 2 (A-E), 3 (A-G), 4 (A-D), 7 (A-I), 10 (B,C)  of the pre-print **Cell competition acts as a purifying selection to eliminate
cells with mitochondrial defects during early mouse
development** (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.900613v2). 

The input data for running the script is availble in the folder Input_data_figures. Additional three files are needed for the script :
1. data_raw.Rda: raw counts matrix for scRNA seq data
2. data_tpm.Rda: normalised (TPM) counts matrix for scRNA seq data
3. raw_counts_allele_mt.csv: matrix with counts information for the four possible alleles for each base on mitochondrial genome.
Due to their big size, they are not part of this repository. They will be soon available online but in the meantime  they are available under request.
